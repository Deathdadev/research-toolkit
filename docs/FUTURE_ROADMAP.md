# Research Toolkit - Future Roadmap

# Disclosure
This roadmap document should be taken with **a grain of salt** as this is an ideal scenario, and in no way reflects what will actually be implemented and when. 

AI has been used as a tool to help implement certain parts of this project, however the blood sweat and tears of current contributers (currently just me) have gone into making this project work.

This project is a proof of concept, and is in no way a finished project.

## Vision

Transform the Research Toolkit into a comprehensive **AI-powered research platform** that enables AI models to conduct rigorous, verifiable research autonomously through standardized tool interfaces.

**Current Status:** v2.0.0 - Production-Ready Foundation  
**Target:** v2.5.0 - Enhanced MCP Integration | v3.0.0 - Full AI Integration Platform
